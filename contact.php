				<h2>Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</h2>

				<p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>

				    <li>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</li><li>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.</li><li>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?</li>

				</ol>

				<h3>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</h3>

				<p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Bender, quit destroying the universe! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>

				<ul>

				    <li>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</li><li>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</li><li>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</li>

				</ul>

				<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>

				<p>I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.</p>

				<p>No! The cat shelter's on to me. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>

				<p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>

				<p>Really?! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. She also liked to shut up!</p>

				<p>And then the battle's not so bad? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Tell them I hate them.</p>

				<p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.</p>

				<p>Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? No! Don't jump! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Ooh, name it after me!</p>

				<p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>

				<p>Who are you, my warranty?! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>

				<p>I don't want to be rescued. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Kif might! Guess again. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
